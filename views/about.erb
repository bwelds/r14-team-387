<h1>About Miletweets</h1>
<p class="lead">What are Miletweets? Well, that's a good question.</p>
<p>Miletweets are essentially milestone tweets. You know those nice cool numbers that people often comment on? Like anything makes your 10,000th tweet more special than the one before. What makes it special is what you write and how you feel about it. So for those of us that feel a little perk on hitting these mini social milestones, I created Miletweets.</p>
<p class="lead">Why do we need an app? Can't I just look at my number of tweets?</p>
<p>Sure you could. Truth be told, there are very few circumstances I can think of where an app is really needed. But they often make things simpler, more convenient, more likely to be done. And some apps make life that much harder. There are actually some Twitter apps that only show an abbreviated/approximate count, e.g. 27k. If you are a Miletweets kind of person, that is of no use.</p>
<p class="lead">So does the app just tell you which milestones are coming up?</p>
<p>That's just the beginning! The first step is to let you know which milestones are coming up, but the app will also give you an idea of about how far away the milestone is based on your average tweet frequency. Not only that, it will send you a reminder closer to the time so you don't forget to pay attention. Even though I had made note of 30,000 approaching I still managed to totally gloss over it because I forgot. I'm aiming at 35,000 tweets now. :-)</p>
<p class="lead">Why did you build this? Are you obsessed with Twitter?</p>
<p>Not at all. I've been trying to get back into coding for a while, and needed things to build. The idea came to me when I missed my recent milestone, and when I saw that Rails Rumble 2014 was approaching, I realized this was something I could probably build in a weekend. Then I could happily say "I BUILT A THING!"
<p class="lead">What else will the app do?</p>
<p>Another fantastic question. I have no idea, lol! I haven't really gone too far in my thinking because I didn't want to over-reach for a weekend project. I guess I'll see what I come up with afterwards.</p>
<p class="lead">Who are you?</p>
<p><img class="img-thumbnail" src="/img/me.jpg">Simple question with no easy answer - I'm a Scotland-born, Jamaican citizen, ex-programmer-come-again/database administrator/project manager, with a passion for learning and a knack for too many things who loves to write (poetry, blogging, fiction, song lyrics), play steel pan, latin dance... Most of which is not relevant to this app, but it's all fun. For more about me, check out my <a href="http://biancawelds.com">website</a>.</p>
